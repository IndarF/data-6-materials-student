    "[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) isn't a programming language – it's a \"markup language\", which means that it is designed to format text to look nice. But like a programming language, Markdown has a set of rules (syntax) that govern how it works. Think of it like a fancy Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the most important rules in Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Double asterisks (`**`) are how we make words bold. `My name is **Jordan**` renders to \"My name is **Jordan**\".\n",
    "- Underscores (`_`) are how we make words italicized. `How are _you_?` renders to How are _you_?, and `what is **_up_**` renders to what is **_up_**.\n",
    "- Hashtags (`#`, `##`, `###`) are how we create titles/headings. The more hashtags you include, the smaller the title is. The title for this question was generated using `## Question 5 – Markdown`.\n",
    "- Bulleted lists are created using the (`-`) character.\n",
    "- Numbered lists are created the same way they're created in a standard word processor, like Google Docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is important to learn because Jupyter Notebooks are often full of Markdown cells (just like this assignment). In future assignments, we will ask you to write answers to written questions using Markdown, and while the majority of your answers will be in plaintext (i.e. with none of the special characters above), learning Markdown is valuable nonetheless.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to recreate the output in the following screenshot, using the Markdown cell below. Feel free to replace \"Bongo Burger\" and \"K-Pop\" with your own favorite food and music genre, but make sure the formatting is the same.\n",
