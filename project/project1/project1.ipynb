    "At first glance of the UC Berkeley Admission dataset, it seems male have higher chance being admitted. However, when looked closer by department, a different story emergered. We found that females were equal or more likely to be admitted when looked at each department. In fact, the original Bickel, Hammel, and O'Connell study found that female applicants disproportionately applied to highly competitive departments with low admission rates (e.g., English), while men more often applied to less competitive departments with higher admission rates. *More female applicants applying to competitive programs skewed the combined data, creating the appearance of bias against female applicants, when in many cases, women were either equally likely or more likely to be admitted compared to men in the same department.*\n",
