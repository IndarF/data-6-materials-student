    "\n",
    "The `barh` (horizontal bar chart) method is used to visualize **categorical** variable values. Categorical variables are non-numbers, like names and qualities (Color, Gender, Name etc.). As we saw in lecture, categorical variables come in 2 different types: *ordinal* and *nominal*. Refer to Chapter 5 of the [course notes](https://data6.org/notes/05-variables/#variable-types) to see the difference between the two types.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `barh` method takes in 1 mandatory argument, which is the **name of the column** you want on the left (vertical) axis of your `barh` plot. There are also optional arguments that have to do with plotting -- you'll see examples of those in this lab and in the homework. The remaining optional arguments in the `datascience` documentation linked above can also be used, feel free to try out some of the others on your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note:** To use the `barh` method properly, we first need to select the columns we want to see in the graph. We should not call `barh` directly on a large `Table` because without specifying a column, we get a bar graph for every single instance of every single variable, which you can imagine results in a lot of bar graphs. Therefore, in the cell below and throughout the lab **we utilize more advanced table functions for aggregating the data to make visualization easier.** Most of these functions are out of scope for this lab or this course. Just focus on the methods and functions for creating the visualizations throughout the lab!"
