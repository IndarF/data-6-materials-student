    "Some details about `sort`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The first argument to `sort` is the name of a column to sort by.\n",
    "* If the column has text in it, `sort` will sort alphabetically; if the column has numbers, it will sort numerically—both in ascending order by default.\n",
    "* The value of `unemployment_totals.sort(label)` is a copy of `unemployment_totals`; the `unemployment_totals` table doesn't get modified.\n",
    "* Rows always \"stick together\" when a table is sorted. It wouldn't make sense to sort just one column and leave the other columns alone. For example, if we sorted just the \"Total\" array, the total unemployment rates would all end up with the wrong months and years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: Create a version of `unemployment_rates` that's sorted by total unemployment rate (\"Total\"), with the largest unemployment rate **first**. Call this new table `unemployment_rate_highest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint_: To sort in descending order, you can provide the optional argument `descending=True`. See the [Python reference](https://data6.org/notes/reference)."
