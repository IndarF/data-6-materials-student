Understanding not only *how* each method works, but also *why* and *when* to use them are the key takeaways from this lab; by the end of it, we will be able to query tables in some pretty cool ways!\n",
    "\n",
    "These new methods allow us to do different operations than before. As such, it is becoming more and more important to remember how each method sits on our Data Science toolbelt. We should think of each new method as a **tool that serves a specific purpose**. Your job as a data scientist is not only to understand what each tool does, but when each tool is applicable in new situations!\n",

    "In this lab, we'll be working with a `movies` data set that contains information about various American films over time. It contains the following columns:\n",
    "1. `\"Film\"`: The name of the movie\n",
    "2. `\"Genre\"`: The genre of the movie\n",
    "3. `\"Year\"`: The year the movie was released\n",
    "4. `\"Lead Studio\"`: The primary movie studio responsible for producing the movie\n",
    "5. `\"Audience score %\"`: The score, out of 100%, given to the movie by viewers\n",
    "6. `\"Rotten Tomatoes %\"`: The score, out of 100%, given to the movies by the website [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)\n",
